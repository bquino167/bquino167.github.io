## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 2 
This  lab, focusing on a two-player guessing game, was a great introduction to basic programming concepts. The use of functions like getValidInput helped me grasp the importance of handling different types of user input. Breaking down repetitive parts into a separate function made the code clearer and easier to work with. Adding comments for clarity in the code showed how documentation can enhance understanding. Overall, this hands-on experience with C++ features in a user-friendly setting provided a practical bridge between what I've learned in theory and how it applies in real programming situations.


Lab 6, part 2
This C++ program for blackjack scoring taught me hands-on stuff like handling inputs and checking for errors. Using command-line arguments and the IsCardName function was cool for making sure the input was right. It's straightforward with clear error messages, making it user-friendly. Working on this, I got a better grip on basic C++ stuff and how it fits into real coding situations. Teaming up with partners also showed how communication matters when coding together. Overall, it was a good experience for practical problem-solving in programming.

Lab 9, part 2
Working on this C++ program about philosopher schedules was pretty hands-on. The idea was to check if both schedules had 'e' at the same spot. It was cool figuring out the code for that. We kept it simple, comparing the schedules bit by bit. If they had 'e' in the same place, it's a no-go. The part where we get the schedules from the user and use the function to check if they're valid felt like solving a little puzzle. Working together with @Swenphoenix made it easier we shared ideas and got it done. This lab helped me see how C++ can be practical for everyday things, like checking schedules.
